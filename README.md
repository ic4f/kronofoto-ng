# kronofoto-ng

**kronofoto-ng** is an Angular-based front-end for the [Foterpan Iowa digital archive](http://fortepan.us). 
It is part of *Kronofoto*, an umbrella term for three loosely coupled applications built to host and
manage a digital archive like Fortepan Iowa:

* kronofoto-ng (public front-end)
* [kronofoto-api](https://github.com/ic4f/kronofoto-api) (API consumed by a web-based front-end) 
* kronofoto-admin (web-based archive management system)

### Expected Release 
Currently, kronofoto-ng is in pre-alpha state; however, it is operational ([current demo version
available here](http://sergey.cs.uni.edu:8080/public/collections)). I expect to have it ready for an
alpha release this summer.

### Customization and Other Collections
Although built for Fortepan Iowa, kronofoto-ng is designed to be (mostly) collection-agnostic and
can be adapted to similar collections.
